                        <h2 class="mb-4 text-center">About Animation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some years ago there was this animation movie called “Soul” that changed my live. It made me see things differently and made me have some hope with my future. 

                        <p>All animation movies have a message behind and they always touch me. Not just because the characters are in their way cute but also because of the message the author is trying to transmit.</p>

                        <p>Like all kinds of ART, is up to the user to interpret as they see the world.</p> 

                        <p>By that time I never truly valued the power of animation. I see in it all kinds of ART! Drawing, sculpting, music, colours, etc. </p>

                        <p>Its hard to make but its magical and it has such as strong impact in people.</p>

                        <p>It was this interest and passion for the topic that made me want to learn more about it. And that's why I decided to do the 3D animation minor in Aalto University.</p>

                        <p>Turns out to be even harder than I was expecting. Especially if you have to do ALL the things for the animation. Going from planing, drawing, sculpting, doing the colours and lights, animating , editing and doing sound. It's a loooooot of work. But of course, in real live, its not like this. A person just focus on one task of all of those.</p>
                        
                        <p>I started this minor while doing a completely different masters in Control Robotics Automation Systems. And therefore I didn't have enough time to put in this minor with all the work and projects I put myself into.</p>

                        <p>However, I manage to follow along with the classes and I learned everything I was required for completing this minor. Which made me proud and happy.</p>

                        <p>I learned a completely new software to me called Maya. By that time I have only done a bit of Blender to sculpt a brain for another project.</p>

                        <p>I learned hoe to sculpt any figure I wanted starting from geometric figures such as cube, sphere etc. </p>

                        <p>This part wasn't the hardest, but still challenging because it's really hard to go from a cube to a percent round cat. However I must say that the quality comes with the practice and I could see some progress in my sculpting throughout the course.</p>

                        <p>We also learned how to color the object and create lights. We learned how to create a skeleton for the objects to move as well as a bunch of other techniques required. </p>

                        <p>For me this was the most challenging part since it required a lot of remembering. Maya is such a huge and powerful Software that if I don't write everything I learned I will forget the next that. And that was what happened. I wouldn't write what a learn and therefore I would have to ask a lot of times to the professor how to do things we have done before.</p>

                        <p>Finally, we have learned how to animate the characters and record them.</p>

                        <p>This was my favourite part even though it takes a loooot of time to animate just a single movement. We get better in animating the more we do. Specially when we get use to our character we already know how to make the movements. Therefore the animation process gets faster and smother. </p>

                        <p>Finally, about my project, I know I didnt have to much time to work on it but I also know that I wanted to have a message behind my story.</p>

                        <p>Therefore I thought about an idea that has a very simple environment but that anyway transmits a lot to the viewer. </p>

                        <p>I'm very proud of my project because it looks like how I wanted and even with so little time I manage to finish and still continue with the same topic and message I wanted to transmit.</p>

                        <p>Bellow are some screenshots of my final project but you can also see the short movie <a class="text-warning" target="_black" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gpnROn03bzohOnAW2L6umD8xiNOwhp4m/view?usp=share_link"> here.</a></p>
