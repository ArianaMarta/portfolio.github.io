                        <p> As a master student in Control Robotic Automatin Systems we have to do a mandatory course called "Project Work" woth of 10cr where we choose a project to work on.</p>
                        <p> Out of all the option we had, Vertical Farming seamed the most interesting one beacuse the idea iself is very interesting practical and actual.</p>
                        <p>I was a bit unsure if I wanted to do this project because I knew we would have to use a software called “Schneider Electric Ecostruxure” to make the automation of the farm and im not a big fan of it.</p>
                        <p>This project is an ongoing project for some years now. So me and my team of 4 had to learn and read all the code that was already done before. </p>
                        <p>Event though we had big dreams of making the farm already growing plants, we had to send the bar a bit low and focus on other things that had to be done first.</p>
                        <p>Our goal was to make a new vertical farm frame, order the pieces and build it as well as make it modular and plug and play.</p>
                        <p>Our group of 4 end it up being just 2 working on it. One of those two did the whole CAD and design for the new vertical fam and ordered the pieces. And the other one, which is me, end it up having the whole software to take care off, because nobody likes it. </p>
                        <p>I had to think about the whole architecture of how to make it modular and plug and play, as well as code all of it. This software is not just about coding, we also have to build some blocks and create variables as well as coding in Structured Text (ST).</p>
                        <p>Bellow you can see some images of the final CAD, a white board of half of what I had to draw and thing for the architecture and finally some screenshots of the code. </p>
                        <p>This project was a challenge for me specially because it was me the responsible for the whole software. But at the end it was very important for me to learn more the software and its always a good felling when we can finish something and have it working. </p>
