                        <p>I wanted to make an easy-to-play instrument for all ages. I find that a drum machine is very intuitive to play and easy to make good music out of it. 
                            With that in mind I decided to turn the "Guess Who?" game into a drum machine.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-4 text-darker-green">Project Description</h3>
                        <p>The project is a drum machine instrument inspired by the "Guess Who?" game. 
                            Its a playful, joyful and interactive experience that can be shared with a friend. 
                            Together you can build the sound of your persona or make the next electronic music hit. 
                            Its educative and suitable for all ages.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-4 text-darker-green">How to Play?</h3>
                        <p>As you can see from the image bellow, the instrument has two boards, one for each player (just like the normal game). Each board has 4 rows and 8 columns.
                        </p>

                        <div class="img mb-3">
                            <img src="img/boards.png" class="img-fluid" width="500" alt="Responsive image">
                        </div>

                        <p>Each row is a sound (kick, snare, hithat, etc) and each column is a step in the 8step drum machine. To make a sound drop the card down where you want it to be played in the sequencer.
                        </p>

                        <p>This game has two modes to choose from. In mode 0 you turn the drum machine into a 16step where player 1 plays the first 8 steps and player 2 plays the last 8 steps. Or you can choose mode 1 (donâ€™t forget to turn around the cards) where the drum machine stays 8 step but the players have different sounds (so its a 8step drum machine with 8 different sounds in total).
                        </p>

                        <p>You can either play the game just by dropping the cards down in the specific places you want the sound to be played or you can play the normal "Guess Who?" game with your opponent. When asking questions to try to find your opponents persona you can hear how it sounds like.
                        </p>

                        <p>Finally, there's the option to change the Decay, Filter and Tone/Volume of each sound. To do so, you have to press the button corresponding to each sound/row (red button corresponds to 1st row, green to 2nd, etc) and move the knobs until it sounds as you desire.
                            The player 1, master player, has two extra knobs to control the Tempo and the main volume, as well as the mode switch and the start/stop button.
                        </p>

                        <p>More importantly, have fun!</p>

                        <p>I was fortunate to exhibit my first version of this work at the <a href="https://medialabdemoday.aalto.fi/media-lab-30-years-exhibition/" target="_black" class="text-darker-green">"Media Lab 30 Years Exhibition"</a>. I was so please and grateful to see everyone having so much fun playing with the instrument. Even the ones that enter not knowing what a drum machine is where able to compose beautiful pieces.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-4 text-darker-green">Future Work</h3>

                        <p>After hearing the visitors feedback I have decided to make smaller updates to the work. 
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                At the moment i only have the images of the instruments but i would like to had the faces so the players can play the normal "Guess Who?" game and hear how it sounds like. I think this way of playing adds a new dimension to the instrument. Every game will compose a new unique song. 
                            </li>
                        
                       

                            <p>Bellow you can see how it will look like. Right now I've made a womans only edition. My motivation was to put people that are not yet too famous but should be more know for the work they have done, and with no surprise the whole lot is pretty much woman.</p>

                            <p>I'm thinking to do other editions with animals or just abstract figures. </p>

                            <div class="img mb-3">
                                <img src="img/faces_1.png" class="img-fluid" width="450" alt="Responsive image">
                                <img src="img/faces_2.png" class="img-fluid" width="450" alt="Responsive image">
                            </div>

                            <li>Finally, I've realized that the mode 0 is not as interesting as I thought would be so I want to change it to something more exciting to play. On top of that, flipping all the 32 cards to change the mode is also not the most efficient, fast or interesting. Therefore, I was given the feedback that it's interesting that we cant see the sound we will play but we adjust accordingly to the feedback we hear. That brings up a new level of embodiment, feedback, action/reaction to the game.</li>

                            <p>Combining this two problems I might do one of the two following ideas:</p>
                                  
                            <ul>
                                <li>Do a blind mode 0 to enhance peoples sensibility to the sounds and creativity on their reactions. Having 8 step sequencer with 8 different sounds from the mode 1. </li>
                                <li>Make the mode 0 be the one where people play the normal "Guess Who?" game maintain it has a 16 step sequencer where the 1st player composes the first 8 steps influenced by their questions and the second player composes the following 8 steps.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
